	•	What it would look like through various stages (interaction, time)
	•	Show the various stages on a macro-scale (far away) and micro-scale (close up, zoomed in)
	•	System design: What does your software interact with? Humans? Then show the interface AND the system design. Other software? Draw a software map showing when, how and under what conditions the pieces of software interact.
Bring in outside references, links and resources demonstrating:
	•	Similar artists, designers, projects, games, methods, visuals, audio
	•	Links to processes involved or influences by (code, biology, weather patterns, the sky is the limit)
	•	Contextual information about the concept, meaning, expression, goal

creatures grow on a piece of canvas, some luminescent, some porous, some secretes, some shaking, some expands
when moving your mouse towards it, some retracts or freeze, some scream, some grows, some starts to destruct itself

goal: explore capability of body, what does it mean to be organic, how to use fully of this body that is given to you. a lot of times we’re too stoic, stiff, insecure about our bodies. we only do that few gestures every day. but the truth is it can be so much freer. i wanna set this part free.

IDEA 2:
interactive map - that goes along with music
themes: body moving in space and time
inspiration: https://www.instagram.com/p/BpKZs-4g7dA/
zoom in/out functionality, we take up spaces in the city, we move in the city, we interact with the city, city changes, we are inside stomach of a moving train that penetrates heart of the city, moving in predictable speed and the most mechanical way possible. comes back to the question of how to set ourselves free. the visuals can be abstract, interact with music, but also captivating to look at.
