final project scheduler:

step 1 (overall description):

This is a world where living organisms thrive. They take on the boldest color, bodies truly free, unafraid to reveal their desires. They are in controlled harmony until you disturb them.

step 2: (specific goals)
- barnacle structure(from project 1) that can expand its opening or extend vertically, with varying size
- segmented pod structure that frantically throws away and retracts its limbs
- seaflower structure that are steady but changes color, use shaders
- make some goose barnacles and anemones!
- pixeled liquids moving through space
- pixeled liquids shoot from organisms
- characteristic sound with each movements

step 3: (organize inspirations)
- visuals: bjork, tidal organisms, mushrooms
- emotions: manhood, the myth of sisyphus
- movements: pina bausch, ballet russe
- sound: kate soper

step 4: 
week 1:
finished barnacle and segmented pod
week 2:
explore shader and create seaflower

week 3:
